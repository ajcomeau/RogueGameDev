4/22/2023 - Food collection and hunger now works.  Eating is necessary for survival and the game includes an R.I.P. screen.  The following keys now work and I'll be adding a help screen this week.
```
Arrows - movement

'd' - drop inventory

'e' - eat

's' - search for hidden doorways

'i' - show inventory

'>' - go down a staircase

'<' - go up a staircase (requires Amulet from level 26

ESC - return to map from inventory screen.
```
CTRL-D will enter a developer mode that shows the entire map.  After this, CTRL-N will switch out a map for a new one.

4/1/2023 - All 26 levels, the Amulet, fog of war and hidden doors are now online.  See the latest chapter at https://www.comeausoftware.com/c-sharp/rogue-csharp-hidden-doorways/.

3/6/2023 - I've started adding some new code and have some new chapters online. 

2/22/2023 - Still working on the writeup at ComeauSoftware.com.  See the latest video with a demo for the StringBuilder class at https://youtu.be/5eNpECYU1cY.  

2/13/2023 - I've been working on the best way to present the lessons for this project online, writing them up and making some code improvements to what's been done so far.  As a result, I haven't moved beyond the hallway generation.  I hope to get the game moving forward again soon, though.  Don't forget to check out the course chapters already online - https://www.comeausoftware.com/tech-category/rogue-csharp/
