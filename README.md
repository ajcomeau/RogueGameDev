# RogueGameDev

2/22/2023 - Still working on the writeup at ComeauSoftware.com.  See the latest video with a demo for the StringBuilder class at https://youtu.be/5eNpECYU1cY.  

2/13/2023 - I've been working on the best way to present the lessons for this project online, writing them up and making some code improvements to what's been done so far.  As a result, I haven't moved beyond the hallway generation.  I hope to get the game moving forward again soon, though.  Don't forget to check out the course chapters already online - https://www.comeausoftware.com/tech-category/rogue-csharp/
