# RogueGameDev

1/11/2023 - Initial randomized dungeon rooms working.

2/13/2023 - I've been working on the best way to present the lessons for this project online, writing them up and making some code improvements to what's been done so far.  As a result, I haven't moved beyond the hallway generation.  I hope to get the game moving forward again soon, though.  Don't forget to check out the course chapters already online - https://www.comeausoftware.com/tech-category/rogue-csharp/
